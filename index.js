  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.

        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:

  TASK 3

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. *** Global Binding *** - in the global scope, the 'this' keyword returns the window object, which stores information on everything created on a web page.
  2. Implicit Binding - when a function is called on an object (function is preceded by a dot), the 'this' references inside the creation of the same object that a function is being called on, are referring to that object. They have context.
  3. New Binding - In the case of a constructor function, the "this" keyword refers to the properties that will be given to the new created object.
  4. Explicit Binding - In the case of .call or .apply methods, you can override what the constructor function object is originally set to.
